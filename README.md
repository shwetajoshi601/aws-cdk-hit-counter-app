# AWS CDK

The AWS CDK is used to deploy your cloud infrastructure.
The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

The application has been built as a part of a [CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/) by AWS.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
